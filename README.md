# Build Enterprise AI Applications


In this workshop, you will learn how to embed AI into enterprise applications without having to build and train algorithms from scratch. You will call AI APIs, such as Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Transcribe, and Amazon Comprehend to access the detailed outputs they provide. With *Media2Cloud (M2C)* as a backend, you will learn how to integrate the AI services into an automated media analysis workflow that extracts detailed metadata for downstream processes.
